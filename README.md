# Create startup.tar.gz for script-repo

Just edit the files you need to and then run
`./create-startup.sh`
then update the repo https://github.com/PrivateRouter-LLC/script-repo

## TODO

Create a github action to do this and upload the package to the repo manually.
  * Ideally create it as a release for the routers to pull.
